      "Francesco Varanzano, the composer, told me how “Dimmi Bello” was born. The song had the initial title: “Dimmi
      bella donna cosa vuoi”. The inspiration for the writing of the text was born from reading an old book. It was an
      ancient text that spoke of vanity. In this song the narcissism and the domination of the patriarchy is reflected.
      Between the notes of a plectrum and the ink of a pen, a timeless poem was written by Francesco and sung by the
      sweet voice of Lucia. “Dimmi Bello” was written in 1986 and is re-printed today after 35 years with the very kind
      permission of two wonderful people who have dedicated their lives to music and love of neighbor, Francesco and
      Lucia."
